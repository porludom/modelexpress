"""Shared K8s P2P CI test — used by all inference engine frameworks.

Runs after the workflow has applied the source and target Jobs and both pods
have reached Running state.  Asserts:
  1. Target pod logs contain the framework-specific P2P transfer marker (--p2p-marker).
  2. Target connected to source NIXL agents covering ranks 0..tp_size-1, with a
     distinct-agent count in [tp_size, tp_size * dp_size] (catches TP collapse
     and source-rank-pairing regressions; the range accommodates interchangeable
     DP replicas that share a rank — see --dp-size).
  3. Both source and target servers respond to /v1/completions — confirms weights
     are loaded and the model is serving correctly on each.
  4. When enabled by the workflow, target peak and final VRAM do not materially
     exceed source VRAM.

Invoked by the workflow as:
  pytest ci/k8s/client/test_p2p_k8s.py -v \
      --namespace $NAMESPACE \
      --model $MX_CI_MODEL \
      --source-port $SOURCE_PORT \
      --worker-port $WORKER_PORT \
      --tp-size $TP_SIZE \
      [--dp-size $DP_SIZE] \
      [--p2p-marker "framework-specific transfer complete string"]

--p2p-marker defaults:
  vLLM:    "RDMA transfer complete"             (emitted by vLLM's RdmaStrategy)
  TRT-LLM: "ModelExpress P2P transfer complete" (printed by trtllm_p2p_launcher.py)

--tp-size default is 1 — every existing TP=1 P2P test still asserts exactly
one source agent, which is the correct expectation and adds a free safety net.

--dp-size default is 1 — with a single copy per rank the accepted range
collapses to exactly tp_size, so TP-only jobs are unaffected. Set it to the
target's data-parallel size (e.g. 2 for the DP=2 job) so the range widens to
[tp_size, tp_size * dp_size] for the interchangeable replicas DP publishes.

    NIXL-only: the assertion scans for remote-agent log lines that the shared
    NixlTransferManager emits. The Mooncake TransferEngine path
    (transport=transfer_engine) transfers via batch_transfer_sync_read and
    never registers NIXL agents, so there is nothing to count — skip it there.

    Each source rank publishes exactly one NIXL agent. The shared
    NixlTransferManager.receive_from_source (in modelexpress.nixl_transfer)
    logs either `add_remote_agent: ... (agent=b'<name>')` for central metadata
    or `Using pre-loaded remote agent <name>` for P2P metadata.

    Two orthogonal checks:

      1. source_ranks == range(tp_size). This is the deterministic invariant:
         the observed source ranks must cover exactly 0..tp_size-1, no matter
         which replica each target core selected. It catches TP collapse (a
         target rank never ran → missing rank) and source-rank collapse (the
         rank filter in _find_source_instances regressed so a target rank
         pulled from the wrong rank). Inference alone can't catch the latter:
         shards share a shape per rank, so a wrong-rank load succeeds with
         garbage values and still produces plausible text.

      2. tp_size <= distinct_agents <= tp_size * dp_size. Distinct-agent count
         is NOT deterministic under DP: DP replicas are interchangeable full
         copies at the SAME worker_rank, so a rank can expose up to dp_size
         agents and each target core of that rank picks one at random (default
         `random` selector). The dp_size cores at a rank therefore land on
         1..dp_size distinct replicas → the total is anywhere in
         [tp_size, tp_size * dp_size]. Asserting == tp_size is only correct
         when dp_size == 1 (pure TP, one candidate per rank); it is a coin-flip
         flake under DP > 1. The lower bound still catches full collapse; the
         upper bound catches agents outside the expected rank set.
