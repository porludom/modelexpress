"""Transfer plan + pull execution.

Ties the pieces together: take a ``CaptureResult`` and the published source
shards, run ``plan_pull`` per captured copy, and collect the byte segments into a
``TransferPlan``. Any source whose slice can't be expressed as a box
(``UnsupportedReshard``), or that has no published shards, or that capture
already flagged, is recorded in ``fallback`` as unsupported. The current
receiver rejects such plans before transfer. Descriptor-heavy but otherwise
supported strided copies use a separate bounded full-source staging path.

``execute_transfer`` turns the planned segments into absolute-address
``ReadDescriptor``s (destination param ``data_ptr()`` resolved at refit time)
and hands them to a ``Transport``.
