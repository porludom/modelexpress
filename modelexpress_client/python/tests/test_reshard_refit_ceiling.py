"""Throughput-ceiling guard: refuse a wire rate the fabric cannot produce.

The incident these tests are anchored to: a receiver holding two of its node's
four network adapters reported 40.61 GB delivered in 0.84 s, an implied 387 Gbps
against a two-adapter ceiling of about 191 Gbps, and delivered nothing. Every
other signal called the run healthy - coverage 100%, fallback 0, addresses and
digests stable - and only the parameter-equality gate dissented, which timing
runs switch off by design.

The numbers below are that record verbatim, so the regression is pinned to
something that happened rather than to a constructed example. The genuine
Topology B run is pinned alongside it, because a guard that rejects real
measurements gets switched off and then protects nothing.

Run: pytest tests/test_reshard_refit_ceiling.py
