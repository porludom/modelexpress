"""The per-refit stage record emitted by ReshardReceiver.update_weights.

A refit is one number to the caller and six or more stages underneath: discovery,
the peer handshake, geometry capture, planning, allocation and registration on the
first step, then wire, re-slice, dtype cast and install on every step. Without a
breakdown a regression can only be described as "refit got slower".

These tests pin the properties a consumer of the record depends on:

  * it is one JSON object per refit at WARNING, so a harness capturing it does not
    have to turn on INFO across every dependency;
  * ``accounted_s`` equals the sum of the stage durations, which is what lets a
    caller compute the unattributed remainder and decide whether to trust the
    breakdown at all;
  * one-time setup costs are attributed to the step that paid them rather than
    silently dropped, so a cold first step accounts for itself;
  * the byte economics travel with the timings, so useful bytes are read off the
    record instead of reconstructed from an assumed sharding afterwards.

The last one is the reason this record exists in this form: a derived
useful-bytes figure once made a half-complete refit look like the faster one.
