"""Timing for the RL generator refit path.

The recorder and its stage vocabulary are covered by ``test_refit_timing``.
What these tests cover is the part that was missing: something on this path
opening a cycle, and the layers underneath it contributing the durations they
already measure. Without it a framework could see the total refit and roughly
18% of its breakdown, with the wire transfer, the reconstruction, post-load
processing and the copy into kernel storage all charged as one span.
